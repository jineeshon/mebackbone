//Docs
For building simple web application with few dom manipulation jQuery is the right way to go, But when we try to add more and more complex functionalities to the web , it becomes extreamly difficult to manage only with jQuery.

Introduction

BackboneJs supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing application over a RESTful JSON interface.

Backbone js is  light-weight JavaScript library created by Jeremy Ashkenas. Its comes with MVC ( Model, View , Controller ) architucture and mainly helps to maintain UI layer.

//View

Backbone js uses jQuery to manupulate the View.
